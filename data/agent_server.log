🚨 **Your Hepatitis B test is POSITIVE.** This means you have been exposed to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).

🧠 Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can be **chronic or acute**. It's spread through blood, sexual contact, or from mother to child.

🩺 **What to do next:** Please consult a hepatologist. You will likely need further tests (e.g., liver function, HBV DNA) to determine if the infection is active or chronic.

📌 Avoid alcohol, get tested for Hepatitis D (which co-infects), and inform partners or close contacts.

💉 Household contacts should be vaccinated if not already. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccines.

🧬 **Hepatitis B Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your Hepatitis B test is POSITIVE.** This means you have been exposed to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).

🧠 Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can be **chronic or acute**. It's spread through blood, sexual contact, or from mother to child.

🩺 **What to do next:** Please consult a hepatologist. You will likely need further tests (e.g., liver function, HBV DNA) to determine if the infection is active or chronic.

📌 Avoid alcohol, get tested for Hepatitis D (which co-infects), and inform partners or close contacts.

💉 Household contacts should be vaccinated if not already. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccines.

🧬 **HIV Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your HIV test is POSITIVE.** This means HIV antibodies were detected in your blood.

🧠 HIV affects the immune system but **can be managed with modern treatments** that allow you to live a long, healthy life.

🩺 **Next Steps:** Schedule a confirmatory test (e.g., Western blot or PCR), and connect with an HIV care provider for antiretroviral therapy (ART).

🧬 **Hepatitis B Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your Hepatitis B test is POSITIVE.** This means you have been exposed to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).

🧠 Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can be **chronic or acute**. It's spread through blood, sexual contact, or from mother to child.

🩺 **What to do next:** Please consult a hepatologist. You will likely need further tests (e.g., liver function, HBV DNA) to determine if the infection is active or chronic.

📌 Avoid alcohol, get tested for Hepatitis D (which co-infects), and inform partners or close contacts.

💉 Household contacts should be vaccinated if not already. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccines.

🧬 **HIV Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your HIV test is POSITIVE.** This means HIV antibodies were detected in your blood.

🧠 HIV affects the immune system but **can be managed with modern treatments** that allow you to live a long, healthy life.

🩺 **Next Steps:** Schedule a confirmatory test (e.g., Western blot or PCR), and connect with an HIV care provider for antiretroviral therapy (ART).

🌍 You are not alone. Millions live successfully with HIV. Support, care, and privacy are available.

📌 Use protection, avoid sharing needles, and educate those around you. This helps reduce stigma and protect others.

🧬 **Hepatitis B Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your Hepatitis B test is POSITIVE.** This means you have been exposed to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).

🧠 Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can be **chronic or acute**. It's spread through blood, sexual contact, or from mother to child.

🩺 **What to do next:** Please consult a hepatologist. You will likely need further tests (e.g., liver function, HBV DNA) to determine if the infection is active or chronic.

📌 Avoid alcohol, get tested for Hepatitis D (which co-infects), and inform partners or close contacts.

💉 Household contacts should be vaccinated if not already. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccines.

🧬 **HIV Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your HIV test is POSITIVE.** This means HIV antibodies were detected in your blood.

🧠 HIV affects the immune system but **can be managed with modern treatments** that allow you to live a long, healthy life.

🩺 **Next Steps:** Schedule a confirmatory test (e.g., Western blot or PCR), and connect with an HIV care provider for antiretroviral therapy (ART).

🌍 You are not alone. Millions live successfully with HIV. Support, care, and privacy are available.

📌 Use protection, avoid sharing needles, and educate those around you. This helps reduce stigma and protect others.

🚨 Malaria test is positive. Seek immediate medical attention.

✅ Widal test is negative. No signs of typhoid fever detected.

⚠️ **Lung Capacity Test:** Capacity is low (< 2.5L). This could indicate restrictive lung issues. Consult a pulmonologist for spirometry and further evaluation.

2025-06-22 18:01:54,174 - root - INFO - Vital signs monitoring result: ⚠️ Glucose is high. This could indicate prediabetes or diabetes. Monitor your diet and consult a doctor.

⚠️ SpO2 is slightly low. Consider improving air quality and practicing deep breathing exercises.

⚠️ Body temperature is high. This could indicate a fever. Stay hydrated and rest.

⚠️ Heart rate is high (Tachycardia). This could be due to stress, dehydration, or other factors. Monitor closely.

✅ Systolic blood pressure is normal. Your cardiovascular health is stable.

✅ Diastolic blood pressure is normal. Your cardiovascular health is stable.

🚨 Waist circumference is high (90–101 cm). This indicates abdominal obesity, which significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Adopt a targeted weight management program and monitor waist size regularly.

⚠️ BMI is overweight (25–29.9). Increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Recommend weight control via reduced sugar, more fiber, and regular aerobic activity.

🧬 **Hepatitis B Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your Hepatitis B test is POSITIVE.** This means you have been exposed to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).

🧠 Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can be **chronic or acute**. It's spread through blood, sexual contact, or from mother to child.

🩺 **What to do next:** Please consult a hepatologist. You will likely need further tests (e.g., liver function, HBV DNA) to determine if the infection is active or chronic.

📌 Avoid alcohol, get tested for Hepatitis D (which co-infects), and inform partners or close contacts.

💉 Household contacts should be vaccinated if not already. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccines.

🧬 **HIV Serology Guide**

🚨 **Your HIV test is POSITIVE.** This means HIV antibodies were detected in your blood.

🧠 HIV affects the immune system but **can be managed with modern treatments** that allow you to live a long, healthy life.

🩺 **Next Steps:** Schedule a confirmatory test (e.g., Western blot or PCR), and connect with an HIV care provider for antiretroviral therapy (ART).

🌍 You are not alone. Millions live successfully with HIV. Support, care, and privacy are available.

📌 Use protection, avoid sharing needles, and educate those around you. This helps reduce stigma and protect others.

🚨 **Malaria Test:** Result is *positive*.

🚨 This may indicate a current infection. Seek immediate medical attention, especially if you have fever, chills, or fatigue.

🧬 **Widal Test Serology Guide**

🚨 **Typhi O (TO):** Reactive — suggests *acute typhoid fever*. Consult your physician immediately.

📌 **Typhi H (TH):** Reactive — indicates *past infection* or typhoid vaccination history.

⚠️ **Paratyphi A (AH):** Reactive — possible *Paratyphoid A infection*. Medical consultation advised.

⚠️ **Paratyphi B (BH):** Reactive — may suggest *Paratyphoid B*. Further testing recommended.

🔬 Overall Summary: Reactive results for: Typhi O, Typhi H, Paratyphi AH, Paratyphi BH. Prompt clinical review is recommended.

⚠️ **Lung Capacity Test:** Capacity is low (< 2.5L). This could indicate restrictive lung issues. Consult a pulmonologist for spirometry and further evaluation.
